### About ðŸ’¯

I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at UC San Diego, expecting to graduate in March 2024.

I'm a Research Intern in the mlPC lab at UCSD, advised by Professor [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) and Dr. [Yifan Xu](https://yfxu.com/). I'm also working on my capstone project under the supervision of Professor [Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/).

I'm currently applying to highly selective master's programs in computer science with a focus on AI/ML, specializing in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). I'm also seeking an internship opportunity in Summer 2024 in related fields.
